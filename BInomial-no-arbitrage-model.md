# Chapter 1: Binomial No-Arbitrage Pricing Model 


# Introduction 

This is a self-study note of stochastic process for finance written by Steven Shreve. In this note, we focus on the discrete stochastic process and the binomial pricing model. The idea is on how to formulate a pricing model using coin tosses analogy. In chapter 1, we will focus on binomial pricing model and how to apply this model for call option.
